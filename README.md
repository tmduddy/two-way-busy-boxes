# two-way-busy-boxes

This is the code I used to power my ESP-32 based tinkering project I'm calling Two Way Busy Boxes.

The goal of this project was to have two devices that could be paired together and used remotely to indicate a "busy" or "free" signal. The idea being that between the two "offices" in my apartment two people could signal if now is a good time to come in or not.
